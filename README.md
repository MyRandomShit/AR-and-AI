# Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence
This combination would drastically improve the human condition.

## Notes
- AR in the future would be ubiquitous
- I could imagine a HUD with voice overlay 
- Apple probably needs an extensible operating system to power AR Apple Glasses

## Pros
- AI Assistant would help you in almost any kind of decision-making scenarios
- A blind person could "see" the surroundings via voice assist
- the software would assist us in almost every aspect of life...
